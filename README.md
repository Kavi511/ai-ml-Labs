üß† AI/ML Workshops Repository
Purpose

A central repository for all AI/ML workshops and practicals ‚Äî including datasets, notebooks, and reports.
Each workshop is self-contained, reproducible, and designed for hands-on learning and academic use.


Workshops Overview

No.	Workshop Title	Key Topics
01	Intro to Python & NumPy	Python basics, NumPy arrays, vectorization, plotting with Matplotlib
02	Data Preprocessing & EDA	Cleaning, missing values, outliers, scaling, visual EDA with Pandas/Seaborn
03	Supervised Classification	Train/test split, k-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, baseline vs improved models
04	Regression Models	Linear & Polynomial Regression, regularization (Ridge/Lasso), error analysis
05	Model Evaluation Metrics	Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, MAE/MSE/RMSE
06	Feature Engineering	Encoding, scaling, binning, text/image features, feature importance
07	Model Tuning & Cross-Validation	Grid/Random search, k-fold CV, pipelines, data leakage prevention
08	Unsupervised Learning	k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN, PCA/t-SNE/UMAP for visualization
09	Neural Networks	MLPs with PyTorch/TensorFlow, activations, loss, optimizers, overfitting control
10	NLP Basics	Text cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF, simple classifiers, intro to embeddings
11	Computer Vision Basics	Image preprocessing, augmentation, CNN fundamentals, transfer learning demo
12	Time Series Analysis	Stationarity, decomposition, ARIMA/Prophet, ML-based forecasting
